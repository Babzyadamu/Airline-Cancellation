# Airline-Cancellation
![](Intro_image.jpg)

## Introduction
This is an analysis of **Airline cancellations** for 2015. The data source was a simple csv file which was Imported to Power BI for this analysis. There were 3 tables used, Flights table, Airlines table & Airports table. A 4th table was created called DAX table to keep all measures calculated.

## Problem Statement
The aim of this analysis is to answer the following Business related questions:
- How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?
- What percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015? 
- Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?
- How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year?
- How many flights were canceled in 2015? 
- What % of cancellations were due to weather? 
- What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?
- Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure?

## Skills & Concept Used:
- Data Modelling
- Creating Calculated Columns using DAX(IF else statements)
- Developing Measures using different functions
- Use of filters
- Data Visualization & Design (Using appropriate visuals to send appropriate message to stakeholders)

## Data Transformation/Cleaning/Manipulation:
- Transformation took place using power query. Column quality/distribution was checked for nulls, values were replaced. In addition, Day of the week & month columns were   created along side conditional columns using (If/else statements)
- Lots of data cleaning was done as there were so many unwanted rows and columns, hence they were removed for this analysis. This helps to enhance performance &   efficiency of Power BI as too much irrelevant data will slow the performance.

## Data Modelling:
By default, Power BI automatically connects different tables using its intelligence; however, this connection doesn't always yield what you want. Hence it is best practice to do the connection yourself and use the star schema approach. This concept involves using the primary & foreign key concept (1 to many relationship concepts). I have a fact table (Flights) and 2 dimension table (Airline & Airport table). Both were connected using 1 to Many relationship. Without this connection, you wonâ€™t be able to interact correctly with your visuals.
